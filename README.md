Jive
====

The very beginning of a crossplatform UI framework for Haxe. It's based on AsWing (https://github.com/longde123/aswing-haxe).

We would like to bring the features below to AsWing.
- Model-View-ViewModel (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel);
- Data Binding (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UI_data_binding);
- The contemporary UI style (http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/);
- The better perfomance.
